# Examples Folder

This folder contains a number of examples that should help you get
starting with the LPC1343 and the codebase.  For the most part,
you simply need to copy the appropriate main.c file to the root
folder of the code base, and recompile in your IDE or by running
'make clean' followed by 'make'.
